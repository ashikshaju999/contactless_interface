# contactless_interface
The mouse is used for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) technology. Currently, wireless 
mouse or a Bluetooth mouse still uses devices and is not free of devices completely since it 
uses a battery for power and a dongle to connect it to the PC. In the proposed Contactless 
Interface system, this limitation can be overcome by employing webcam or a built-in camera 
for capturing of hand gestures and hand tip detection using computer vision. 
The algorithm used in the system makes use of the machine learning algorithm. Based on the 
hand gestures, the computer can be controlled virtually and can perform left click, right click 
and computer cursor function without the use of the physical mouse. The algorithm is based 
on deep learning for detecting the hands. Hence, the proposed system will avoid COVID-19 
spread by eliminating the human intervention and dependency of devices to control the 
computer. 
The project can be implemented in places like metro stations, ATMs, cinema halls, hospitals, 
etc
